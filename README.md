ðŸ“Š Investment and Risk Preferences â€“ Project Report

ðŸ”¹ Introduction

This project explores how individuals make financial decisions based on their risk tolerance and investment preferences. It examines the balance between expected returns and the fear of losses, considering both traditional finance theories and behavioral finance factors such as overconfidence, herd behavior, and loss aversion.

ðŸ”¹ Objectives
	â€¢	Study the relationship between demographics (age, income, education, literacy) and risk preferences.
	â€¢	Identify behavioral biases influencing investment decisions.
	â€¢	Categorize investors into different risk tolerance groups.
	â€¢	Provide insights for better financial planning and advisory services.

ðŸ”¹ Methodology
	â€¢	Quantitative survey using Google Forms.
	â€¢	Data collected on demographics, income, education, and investment interest.
	â€¢	Analysis done using correlation, regression, and factor analysis.
	â€¢	Investors classified by risk tolerance and behavior.

ðŸ”¹ Key Findings
	â€¢	Males preferred high-return, high-risk investments (stocks, mutual funds, crypto).
	â€¢	Females leaned toward safer options (FDs, gold, insurance).
	â€¢	Young investors (18â€“25) showed higher risk appetite, mostly experimenting with digital assets and stocks.
	â€¢	Middle-aged investors (26â€“35) balanced mutual funds with equities.
	â€¢	Older investors (36+) prioritized secure investments like real estate, PPF, and fixed deposits.

ðŸ”¹ Implications
	â€¢	Financial advisors can tailor strategies to individual risk profiles.
	â€¢	Financial institutions can design customized products for different groups.
	â€¢	Policymakers should promote financial literacy programs to reduce the effect of behavioral biases.

ðŸ”¹ Conclusion

The project concludes that investment behavior is not purely rational; it is shaped by age, income, education, and psychological biases. Understanding these patterns helps in designing effective financial products, policies, and advisory models.
